# RouterRegister
RouterRegister allows routes to be defined in application source code
using PHP [Attributes](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.attributes.php)
amd [Enumerations](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.enumerations.php).

RouterRegister parses RouterRegister attributes and enumerations in application source code
and generates an array of tree structures each of which represent the groups and routes, 
and their attributes (host and middleware), in a top level group as defined in the application Group Enumeration.

## Installation
RouterRegister is installed as a dependency of a framework specific RouterRegister Writer package.
