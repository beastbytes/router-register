# RouterRegister
RouterRegister is a Yii console command package that allows routes to be defined in the application source files
using PHP Attributes; it generates router groups and routes configuration files from the attributes.

There are a number of benefits of defining and registering routes using RouterRegister:

* Self-documenting code — it's clear that a method corresponds to a given route and what parameters, hosts, middleware apply
to the route.
* Single point of truth — each route, its URI and name is defined in an enumeration, making maintenance simpler and 
providing IDE code completion.
* Simplifies development and eliminates typos — IDE code completion for routes works when generating URLs too.

RouterRegister supports grouping routes.

## RouteInterface
RouteInterface routes provide the ```getRouteName()``` method
to get the route name when generating URLs in application code.

```PHP
/** @var Yiisoft\Router\UrlGeneratorInterface $urlGenerator */
/** ApplicationRoute implements BeastBytes\Router\Register\RouteInterface */
$urlGenerator->generate(ApplicationRoute::home->getRouteName())
```

## Installation

Install RouterRegister using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

Add the following to the require-dev section of your composer.json:

```json
"beastbytes/router-register": "<version-constraint>",
```

or run

```PHP
php composer.phar require -dev "beastbytes/router-register:<version-constraint>"
```

## Usage
Using RouterRegister involves:
* [Configure the router](Yii-Router-Configuration.md)
* [Defining routes](Defining-Routes.md)
* [Defining groups](Defining-Groups.md) (if required)
* [Assigning groups and routes in source code](Assigning-Routes-and-Groups-in-Source-Code.md)
* [Run the Yii console command](Yii-Console-router-register-Command.md)
* [UrlGenerator](UrlGenerator.md)

> File watchers can automatically generate the groups and routes as you develop your application.
